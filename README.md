Money Saver is a budget tracker app that tracks user's transactions both online and offline. User can input expenses and deposits by "subtracting funds" and "adding funds". If the user does not have internet connection, the app will store the expenses and deposits in an API (IndexedDB). When the internet connection is restored, transactions made during offline mode will be added and the total will be updated. The user will be notified when funds have been subtracted from their total and when funds have been added to their total. In addition, user will be notified when offline transactions have been added successfully.
